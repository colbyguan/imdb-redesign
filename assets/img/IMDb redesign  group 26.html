					<img class="img-float" src="./IMDb redesign  group 26_files/newsitem1.jpg"> Eli Roth has come on board as an exec producer on the remake of his 2002 horror film "Cabin Fever."

					<p>The remake stars Gage Golightly ("Teen Wolf"), Dustin Ingram ("Paranormal Activity 3"), Samuel Davis (TV's "From Dusk Till Dawn"), Matthew Daddario and Nadine Crocker. It uses Roth's original script, which follows a group of college students who rent a cabin for partying and fall victim to a flesh-eating virus.</p>

					<p>The film started shooting this week in Portland, Ore. Cassian Elwes is executive producing along with Roth, Ike and Jaclyn Ann Suri, plus Peter Fruchtman and Gerald Fructman. Travis Zariwny ("Intruder") is directing and Armory and Pelican Point Media are financing. Producers are Contend's Evan Astrowsky - who produced the original film with Roth - and Armory Films' Chris Lemole and Tim Zajaros.</p>

					<p>"Travis had an amazing vision for my original script, and, as a scary movie fan, I really wanted to see it"

					<p>The 36-year-old attended the Lana Del Rey concert on Friday night at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where he was photographed gleefully running away from a shutterbug lying on the ground beside him with his left fist raised in the air. </p>

					<p>While it's unclear what occurred between the two, an eyewitness tells E! News that Franco ran head first into the photog and tackled him football style, adding that the thesp was laughing but did not appear to be joking around.</p>
