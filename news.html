					<img class = "img-float" src = "assets/img/newsitem1.jpg"> Eli Roth has come on board as an exec producer on the remake of his 2002 horror film "Cabin Fever."

					<p>The remake stars Gage Golightly ("Teen Wolf"), Dustin Ingram ("Paranormal Activity 3"), Samuel Davis (TV's "From Dusk Till Dawn"), Matthew Daddario and Nadine Crocker. It uses Roth's original script, which follows a group of college students who rent a cabin for partying and fall victim to a flesh-eating virus.</p>

					<p>The film started shooting this week in Portland, Ore. Cassian Elwes is executive producing along with Roth, Ike and Jaclyn Ann Suri, plus Peter Fruchtman and Gerald Fructman. Travis Zariwny ("Intruder") is directing and Armory and Pelican Point Media are financing. Producers are Contend's Evan Astrowsky - who produced the original film with Roth - and Armory Films' Chris Lemole and Tim Zajaros.</p>

					<p>"Travis had an amazing vision for my original script, and, as a scary movie fan, I really wanted to see it"
