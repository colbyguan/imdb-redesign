              THE BUZZ: It's refreshing to see a movie of this caliber, a courtroom drama that recalls certain hits from the 1980s and 90s hits, more concerned with serving a broad audience than critics or potential Academy voters. Right down to the trailer's overt music cues, David Dobkin, his cast, and Warner Bros. are grandstanding for the public's atten- tion, and I imagine they'll be rewarded with a strong hold at the box office over the first several weeks. It's defi- nitely a change-up for Dobkin, who breaks from his series of increasingly undistinguished but popular comedies for something with a touch more gravitas. There's also plenty of cursin' spat back and forth between Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr., so much so that an R rating was slapped on faster than Vera Farmiga's tattoo.
